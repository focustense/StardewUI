# Class ButtonResolver

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Input](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

Helper for resolving button state reported by vanilla menu code.

```cs
public static class ButtonResolver
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) â‡¦ ButtonResolver

## Remarks

Stardew's menu system is quite obnoxious about trying to "simplify" button handling and doesn't provide a lot of escape hatches. In addition, the buttons it considers to be the same are not equivalent to the way normal gameplay operates; for example, gamepad controls use A as the action button which is the same as a right-click when interacting with the game world; however, in menus A is the same as a left-click while X is right click. 

 Going through this class can help identify the correct "function" of a button in a UI context as well as identify which real button was actually pressed, the better to work with input suppressions and similar concerns.
