# Class DecoratorView

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Widgets](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

A view that owns and delegates to an inner view.

```cs
public class DecoratorView : StardewUI.Widgets.DecoratorView<T>
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [DecoratorView&lt;T&gt;](decoratorview-1.md) ⇦ DecoratorView

## Remarks

Decorator views, while not abstract, are used as a base type for other composite views, and primarily intended for framework use. Custom widgets should normally use [ComponentView&lt;T&gt;](componentview-1.md) instead, which incorporates lazy loading and other conveniences for minimalistic implementations. 

 The inner view is considered to be owned by the decorator; it will be assigned any values that were assigned to the decorator itself, such as [Layout](../iview.md#layout), and if it implements [IDisposable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable), then it will be disposed along with the decorator.
