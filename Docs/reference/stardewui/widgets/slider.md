#### FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)

Finds the next focusable component in a given direction that does _not_ overlap with a current position.

```cs
public override StardewUI.Input.FocusSearchResult FocusSearch(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 position, StardewUI.Direction direction);
```

##### Parameters

**`position`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
The current cursor position, relative to this view. May have dimensions that are negative or outside the view bounds, indicating that the cursor is not currently within the view.

**`direction`** &nbsp; [Direction](../direction.md)  
The direction of cursor movement.

##### Returns

[FocusSearchResult](../input/focussearchresult.md)

  The next focusable view reached by moving in the specified `direction`, or `null` if there are no focusable descendants that are possible to reach in that direction.

##### Remarks

If `position` is out of bounds, it does not necessarily mean that the view should return `null`; the expected result depends on the `direction` also. The base case is when the focus position is already in bounds, and in this case a view should return whichever view can be reached by moving from the edge of that view along a straight line in the specified `direction`. However, focus search is recursive and the result should reflect the "best" candidate for focus if the cursor were to move _into_ this view's bounds. For example, in a 1D horizontal layout the rules might be: 

  - If the `direction` is [East](../direction.md#east), and the position's X value is negative, then the result should the leftmost focusable child, regardless of Y value.
  - If the direction is [South](../direction.md#south), and the X position is within the view's horizontal bounds, and the Y value is negative or greater than the view's height, then result should be whichever child intersects with that X position.
  - If the direction is [West](../direction.md#west) and the X position is negative, or the direction is [East](../direction.md#east) and the X position is greater than the view's width, then the result should be `null` as there is literally nothing the view knows about in that direction.

 There are no strict rules for how a view performs focus search, but in general it is assumed that a view implementation understands its own layout and can accommodate accordingly; for example, a grid would follow essentially the same rules as our "list" example above, with additional considerations for navigating rows. "Ragged" 2D layouts might have complex rules requiring explicit neighbors, and therefore are typically easier to implement as nested lanes.

-----

#### OnLayout()

Runs whenever layout occurs as a result of the UI elements changing.

```cs
protected override void OnLayout();
```

-----

### Events

#### ValueChange

Event raised when the [Value](slider.md#value) changes.

```cs
public event EventHandler<System.EventArgs>? ValueChange;
