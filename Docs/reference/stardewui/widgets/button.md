## Details

### Constructors

#### Button()



```cs
public Button();
```

-----

### Properties

#### Content

Content view to display inside the button frame.

```cs
public StardewUI.IView Content { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[IView](../iview.md)

```

##### Property Value

[SpriteFont](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteFont.html)

##### Remarks

This setting only applies when the [Content](button.md#content) view is a [Label](label.md), either via passing in a [Label](label.md) directly or by setting [Text](button.md#text).

-----

#### HoverBackground

Alternate background sprite when the button has cursor focus.

```cs
public StardewUI.Graphics.Sprite HoverBackground { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Sprite](../graphics/sprite.md)

-----

#### Margin

Margin to add outside the button.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Edges Margin { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Edges](../layout/edges.md)

-----

#### ShadowVisible

Whether or not to display a drop shadow for the button frame. Default `false`.

```cs
