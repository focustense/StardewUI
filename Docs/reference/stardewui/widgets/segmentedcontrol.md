# Class SegmentedControl

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Widgets](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

A horizontal list of options that can each be independently clicked and selected.

```cs
public class SegmentedControl : StardewUI.View
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [View](../view.md) ⇦ SegmentedControl

## Remarks

Segmented controls are a more discoverable and much more controller-friendly version of a [DropDownList&lt;T&gt;](dropdownlist-1.md) and are particularly effective when the number of possible options ([Children](segmentedcontrol.md#children)) is limited to about five.

```cs
public StardewUI.Graphics.Sprite Highlight { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Sprite](../graphics/sprite.md)

##### Remarks

Always stretched to the exact dimensions of the selected segment, so a nine-slice sprite is recommended.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color HighlightTint { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Color](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html)

public StardewUI.Graphics.Sprite Separator { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Sprite](../graphics/sprite.md)

##### Remarks

Separators are always drawn with the specified [SeparatorWidth](segmentedcontrol.md#separatorwidth), if specified, or the sprite's native width if not, and are always stretched to the full layout height. No separators are drawn before the first segment or after the last segment.

-----

Tint color with which to draw the [Separator](segmentedcontrol.md#separator) sprite.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color SeparatorTint { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Color](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html)

```

##### Property Value

[Alignment](../layout/alignment.md)

-----

### Methods

#### FindFocusableDescendant(Vector2, Direction)

Searches for a focusable child within this view that is reachable in the specified `direction`, and returns a result containing the view and search path if found.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.Input.FocusSearchResult FindFocusableDescendant(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 contentPosition, StardewUI.Direction direction);
```

##### Parameters

**`contentPosition`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
The search position, relative to where this view's content starts (after applying margin, borders and padding).

**`direction`** &nbsp; [Direction](../direction.md)  
The search direction.

##### Returns

[FocusSearchResult](../input/focussearchresult.md)

##### Remarks

This is the same as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) but in pre-transformed content coordinates, and does not require checking for "self-focus" as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) already does this. The default implementation simply returns `null` as most views do not have children; subclasses with children must override this.

-----

#### GetLocalChildren()

Gets the view's children with positions relative to the content area.

```cs
protected override System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<StardewUI.ViewChild> GetLocalChildren();
```

##### Returns

[IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1)<[ViewChild](../viewchild.md)>

##### Remarks

This has the same signature as [GetChildren()](../view.md#getchildren) but assumes that coordinates are in the same space as those used in [OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#ondrawcontentispritebatch), i.e. not accounting for margin/border/padding. These coordinates are automatically adjusted in the [GetChildren()](../view.md#getchildren) to be relative to the entire view. 

 The default implementation returns an empty sequence. Composite views must override this method in order for user interactions to behave correctly.

-----

#### IsContentDirty()

Checks whether or not the internal content/layout has changed.

```cs
protected override bool IsContentDirty();
```

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

  `true` if content has changed; otherwise `false`.

##### Remarks

The base implementation of [IsDirty()](../view.md#isdirty) only checks if the base layout attributes have changed, i.e. [Layout](../view.md#layout), [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), etc. It does not know about content/data in any subclasses; those that accept content parameters (like text) will typically use [DirtyTracker&lt;T&gt;](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md) to hold that content and should implement this method to check their [IsDirty](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) states.

-----

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).

-----

#### OnUpdate(TimeSpan)

Runs on every update tick.

```cs
public override void OnUpdate(System.TimeSpan elapsed);
```

##### Parameters

**`elapsed`** &nbsp; [TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan)  
Time elapsed since last game tick.

##### Remarks

Provided as an escape hatch for very unusual scenarios like responding to flips in the game's gamepadControls state. 

**Override this at your own extreme peril.** Frequently performing any layout-affecting logic in this function can negate the performance benefits of a retained-mode UI and cause the UI to become sluggish or even completely unresponsive.  Do not use it for animation; use [Animator](../animation/animator.md) instead.

-----

#### ResetDirty()

Resets any dirty state associated with this view.

```cs
protected override void ResetDirty();
```

##### Remarks

This is called at the end of [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2), so that on the next pass, all state appears clean unless it was marked dirty after the last pass completed. The default implementation is a no-op; subclasses should use it to clear any private dirty state, e.g. via [ResetDirty()](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#resetdirty).

-----
