## Details

### Constructors

#### Grid()



```cs
public Grid();
```

-----

### Properties

#### Children

Child views to display in this layout, arranged according to the [ItemLayout](grid.md#itemlayout).

```cs
public System.Collections.Generic.IList<StardewUI.IView> Children { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[IList](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ilist-1)<[IView](../iview.md)>

-----

#### GridAlignment

Specifies how to align the entire grid when the combined length of all columns is not exactly equal to the grid's layout length.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Alignment GridAlignment { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Alignment](../layout/alignment.md)

##### Remarks

Applies only to the grid's [PrimaryOrientation](grid.md#primaryorientation) axis, which is the axis affected by [ItemLayout](grid.md#itemlayout); the secondary axis does not require or support grid-level alignment because it can already be made [Content()](../layout/length.md#content)-sized.

-----

#### HorizontalItemAlignment

Specifies how to align each child [IView](../iview.md) horizontally within its respective cell, i.e. if the view is narrower than the cell's width.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Alignment HorizontalItemAlignment { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Alignment](../layout/alignment.md)

-----

#### ItemLayout

The layout for items (cells) in this grid.

```cs
public StardewUI.Widgets.GridItemLayout ItemLayout { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[GridItemLayout](griditemlayout.md)

##### Remarks

Layouts are relative to the [PrimaryOrientation](grid.md#primaryorientation). [Count](griditemlayout.count.md) specifies the number of columns when [Horizontal](../layout/orientation.md#horizontal), and number of rows when [Vertical](../layout/orientation.md#vertical); similarly, [Length](griditemlayout.length.md) specifies the column width when horizontal and row height when vertical. The other dimension is determined by the individual item's own [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md). 

 Note that this affects the _limits_ for individual items, not necessarily their exact size. Children may be smaller than the cells that contain them, and if so are positioned according to the [HorizontalItemAlignment](grid.md#horizontalitemalignment) and [VerticalItemAlignment](grid.md#verticalitemalignment).

-----

#### ItemSpacing

Spacing between the edges of adjacent columns ([X](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html#Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Vector2)) and rows ([Y](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html#Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Vector2)).

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 ItemSpacing { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)

##### Remarks

Setting this is roughly equivalent to specifying the same [Margin](../view.md#margin) on each child, except that it will not add extra space before the first item or after the last item.

-----

#### PrimaryOrientation

Specifies the axis that items are added to before wrapping.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Orientation PrimaryOrientation { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Orientation](../layout/orientation.md)

##### Remarks

[Horizontal](../layout/orientation.md#horizontal) means children are added from left to right, and when reaching the edge or max column count, start over at the beginning of the next row. [Vertical](../layout/orientation.md#vertical) means children flow from top to bottom, and when reaching the bottom, wrap to the top of the next column. 

 Also affects which dimension is fixed and which is potentially unbounded. Horizontally-oriented grids have a fixed width and can grow to any height (if [Height](../layout/layoutparameters.md#height) is set to [Content()](../layout/length.md#content)). Vertically-oriented grids are the opposite, having a fixed height and growing to an arbitrary width.

-----

#### VerticalItemAlignment

Specifies how to align each child [IView](../iview.md) vertically within its respective cell, i.e. if the view is shorter than the cell's height.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Alignment VerticalItemAlignment { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Alignment](../layout/alignment.md)

-----

### Methods

#### FindFocusableDescendant(Vector2, Direction)

Searches for a focusable child within this view that is reachable in the specified `direction`, and returns a result containing the view and search path if found.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.Input.FocusSearchResult FindFocusableDescendant(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 contentPosition, StardewUI.Direction direction);
```

##### Parameters

**`contentPosition`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
The search position, relative to where this view's content starts (after applying margin, borders and padding).

**`direction`** &nbsp; [Direction](../direction.md)  
The search direction.

##### Returns

[FocusSearchResult](../input/focussearchresult.md)

##### Remarks

This is the same as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) but in pre-transformed content coordinates, and does not require checking for "self-focus" as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) already does this. The default implementation simply returns `null` as most views do not have children; subclasses with children must override this.

-----

#### GetLocalChildren()

Gets the view's children with positions relative to the content area.

```cs
protected override System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<StardewUI.ViewChild> GetLocalChildren();
```

##### Returns

[IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1)<[ViewChild](../viewchild.md)>

##### Remarks

This has the same signature as [GetChildren()](../view.md#getchildren) but assumes that coordinates are in the same space as those used in [OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#ondrawcontentispritebatch), i.e. not accounting for margin/border/padding. These coordinates are automatically adjusted in the [GetChildren()](../view.md#getchildren) to be relative to the entire view. 

 The default implementation returns an empty sequence. Composite views must override this method in order for user interactions to behave correctly.

-----

#### GetLocalChildrenAt(Vector2)

Searches for all views at a given position relative to the content area.

```cs
protected override System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<StardewUI.ViewChild> GetLocalChildrenAt(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 contentPosition);
```

##### Parameters

**`contentPosition`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
The search position, relative to where this view's content starts (after applying margin, borders and padding).

##### Returns

[IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1)<[ViewChild](../viewchild.md)>

  The views at the specified `contentPosition`, in original layout order.

##### Remarks

The default implementation performs a linear search on all children and returns all whose bounds overlap the specified `contentPosition`. Views can override this to provide optimized implementations for their layout, or handle overlapping views.

-----

#### IsContentDirty()

Checks whether or not the internal content/layout has changed.

```cs
protected override bool IsContentDirty();
```

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

  `true` if content has changed; otherwise `false`.

##### Remarks

The base implementation of [IsDirty()](../view.md#isdirty) only checks if the base layout attributes have changed, i.e. [Layout](../view.md#layout), [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), etc. It does not know about content/data in any subclasses; those that accept content parameters (like text) will typically use [DirtyTracker&lt;T&gt;](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md) to hold that content and should implement this method to check their [IsDirty](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) states.

-----

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).

-----

#### ResetDirty()

Resets any dirty state associated with this view.

```cs
protected override void ResetDirty();
```

##### Remarks

This is called at the end of [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2), so that on the next pass, all state appears clean unless it was marked dirty after the last pass completed. The default implementation is a no-op; subclasses should use it to clear any private dirty state, e.g. via [ResetDirty()](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#resetdirty).
