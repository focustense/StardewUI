# Class Spacer

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Widgets](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

An empty view whose sole purpose is to separate other elements.

```cs
public class Spacer : StardewUI.View
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [View](../view.md) ⇦ Spacer

## Remarks

The size of the view is entirely controlled by its [Layout](../view.md#layout); that is, it is considered to have no content and setting both dimensions to [Content()](../layout/length.md#content) will cause it to disappear.

## Details

### Constructors

#### Spacer()



```cs
public Spacer();
```

-----

### Methods

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).
