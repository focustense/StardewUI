Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

Controls the scrolling of a [ScrollContainer](scrollcontainer.md).

```cs
[StardewUI.GenerateDescriptor]
public class Scrollbar : StardewUI.Widgets.ComponentView<T>
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [DecoratorView&lt;T&gt;](decoratorview-1.md) ⇦ [ComponentView&lt;T&gt;](componentview-1.md) ⇦ Scrollbar

## Remarks

Must be associated with a [ScrollContainer](scrollcontainer.md) in order to work; will not draw if the container is not set or if its [ScrollSize](scrollcontainer.md#scrollsize) is zero.
