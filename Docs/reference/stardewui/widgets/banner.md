# Class Banner

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Widgets](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

Draws banner-style text with an optional background.

```cs
[StardewUI.GenerateDescriptor]
public class Banner : StardewUI.View
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [View](../view.md) ⇦ Banner

## Remarks

This is very similar to a [Label](label.md) inside a [Frame](frame.md), but uses the special SpriteText font which is more prominent than any of the game's available [SpriteFont](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteFont.html)s and often used for top-level headings/menu titles.

## Details

### Constructors

#### Banner()



```cs
public Banner();
```

-----

### Properties

#### Background

Background sprite (including border) to draw underneath the text.

```cs
public StardewUI.Graphics.Sprite Background { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Sprite](../graphics/sprite.md)

-----

#### BackgroundBorderThickness

The thickness of the border edges within the [Background](banner.md#background). sprite.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Edges BackgroundBorderThickness { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Edges](../layout/edges.md)

##### Remarks

This property has no effect on the appearance of the [Background](banner.md#background), but affects how content is positioned inside the border. It is often correct to set it to the same value as the [FixedEdges](../graphics/sprite.md#fixededges) of the [Background](banner.md#background) sprite, but the values are considered independent.

-----

#### Text

The text to display within the banner.

```cs
public string Text { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string)

-----

#### TextShadowAlpha

Alpha value for the text shadow, per layer in [ShadowLayers](shadowlayers.md).

```cs
public float TextShadowAlpha { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Single](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.single)

##### Remarks

If set to zero, no text shadow will be drawn.

-----

#### TextShadowColor

Base color for the text shadow, before applying [TextShadowAlpha](banner.md#textshadowalpha).

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color TextShadowColor { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Color](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html)

-----

#### TextShadowLayers

Specifies which layers of the text shadow should be drawn.

```cs
public StardewUI.Widgets.ShadowLayers TextShadowLayers { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[ShadowLayers](shadowlayers.md)

##### Remarks

Layers are additive, so the same [TextShadowAlpha](banner.md#textshadowalpha) will have a different visual intensity depending on which layers are allowed. If set to [None](shadowlayers.md#none), then no shadow will be drawn.

-----

#### TextShadowOffset

Offset to draw the text shadow, which is a second copy of the [Text](banner.md#text) drawn entirely black. Text shadows will not be visible unless [TextShadowAlpha](banner.md#textshadowalpha) is non-zero.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 TextShadowOffset { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)

-----

### Methods

#### GetBorderThickness()

Measures the thickness of each edge of the border, if the view has a border.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.Layout.Edges GetBorderThickness();
```

##### Returns

[Edges](../layout/edges.md)

  The border edge thicknesses.

##### Remarks

Used only by views that will implement a border via [OnDrawBorder(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#ondrawborderispritebatch). The border thickness is considered during layout, and generally treated as additional [Padding](../view.md#padding) for the purposes of setting allowed content size. 

 Borders usually have a static size, but if the thickness can change, then implementations must account for it in their dirty checking ([IsContentDirty()](../view.md#iscontentdirty)).

-----

#### IsContentDirty()

Checks whether or not the internal content/layout has changed.

```cs
protected override bool IsContentDirty();
```

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

  `true` if content has changed; otherwise `false`.

##### Remarks

The base implementation of [IsDirty()](../view.md#isdirty) only checks if the base layout attributes have changed, i.e. [Layout](../view.md#layout), [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), etc. It does not know about content/data in any subclasses; those that accept content parameters (like text) will typically use [DirtyTracker&lt;T&gt;](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md) to hold that content and should implement this method to check their [IsDirty](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) states.

-----

#### OnDrawBorder(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the view's border, if it has one.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawBorder(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying [Margin](../view.md#margin) but before [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).

-----

#### ResetDirty()

Resets any dirty state associated with this view.

```cs
protected override void ResetDirty();
```

##### Remarks

This is called at the end of [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2), so that on the next pass, all state appears clean unless it was marked dirty after the last pass completed. The default implementation is a no-op; subclasses should use it to clear any private dirty state, e.g. via [ResetDirty()](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#resetdirty).
