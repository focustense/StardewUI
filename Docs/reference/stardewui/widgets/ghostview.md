# Class GhostView

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Widgets](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

A view that draws an exact copy of another view, generally with a tint and transparency to indicate that it is not the original view. Can be used for dragging, indicating target snap positions, etc.

```cs
[StardewUI.GenerateDescriptor]
public class GhostView : StardewUI.View
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [View](../view.md) ⇦ GhostView

## Remarks

The [RealView](ghostview.md#realview) must be part of a real layout in order for the ghosting to work correctly; [GhostView](ghostview.md) does no layout or layout-forwarding of its own.

## Details

### Constructors

#### GhostView()



```cs
public GhostView();
```

-----

### Properties

#### RealView

The view for which a copy will be drawn.

```cs
public StardewUI.IView RealView { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[IView](../iview.md)

-----

#### TintColor

Color of the ghost.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color TintColor { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Color](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html)

##### Remarks

This tint is multiplied against the [RealView](ghostview.md#realview)'s pixel values and acts as a recolor; for example, specifying [Red](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html#Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Color) here will result in the ghost being entirely red and black.

-----

### Methods

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).
