## Details

### Constructors

#### Frame()



```cs
public Frame();
```

-----

### Properties

#### Background

The background sprite to draw for this frame.

```cs
public StardewUI.Graphics.Sprite Background { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Sprite](../graphics/sprite.md)

-----

#### BackgroundTint

Tint color for the [Background](frame.md#background) image.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color BackgroundTint { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Color](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html)

-----

#### Border

The border sprite to draw for this frame.

```cs
public StardewUI.Graphics.Sprite Border { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Sprite](../graphics/sprite.md)

##### Remarks

Setting a border here does not affect layout, even if [FixedEdges](../graphics/sprite.md#fixededges) are set to non-zero values, since fixed edges only govern scaling and are not necessarily the same as the actual edge thicknesses. To ensure that inner content does not overlap with the border, [BorderThickness](frame.md#borderthickness) should also be set when using a border.

-----

#### BorderThickness

The thickness of the border edges.

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Edges BorderThickness { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Edges](../layout/edges.md)

##### Remarks

This property has no effect on the appearance of the [Border](frame.md#border), but affects how content is positioned inside the border. It is often correct to set it to the same value as the [FixedEdges](../graphics/sprite.md#fixededges) of the [Border](frame.md#border) sprite, but the values are considered independent.

-----

#### BorderTint

Tint color for the [Border](frame.md#border) image.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color BorderTint { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Color](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.html)

-----

#### Content

The inner content view, which will render inside the border and padding.

```cs
public StardewUI.IView Content { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[IView](../iview.md)

-----

#### HorizontalContentAlignment

Specifies how to align the [Content](frame.md#content) horizontally within the frame's area. Only has an effect if the frame's content area is larger than the content size, i.e. when [Width](../layout/layoutparameters.md#width) does _not_ use [Content](../layout/lengthtype.md#content).

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Alignment HorizontalContentAlignment { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Alignment](../layout/alignment.md)

-----

#### ShadowAlpha

Alpha value for the shadow. If set to the default of zero, no shadow will be drawn.

```cs
public float ShadowAlpha { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Single](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.single)

-----

#### ShadowCount

Number of shadows to draw if [ShadowAlpha](frame.md#shadowalpha) is non-zero.

```cs
public int ShadowCount { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Int32](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32)

##### Remarks

While rare, some game sprites are supposed to be drawn with multiple stacked shadows. If this number is higher than the default of `1`, shadows will be drawn stacked with the offset repeatedly applied.

-----

#### ShadowOffset

Offset to draw the sprite shadow, which is a second copy of the [Background](frame.md#background) drawn entirely black. Shadows will not be visible unless [ShadowAlpha](frame.md#shadowalpha) is non-zero.

```cs
public Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 ShadowOffset { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)

-----

#### VerticalContentAlignment

Specifies how to align the [Content](frame.md#content) vertically within the frame's area. Only has an effect if the frame's content area is larger than the content size, i.e. when [Height](../layout/layoutparameters.md#height) does _not_ use [Content](../layout/lengthtype.md#content).

```cs
public StardewUI.Layout.Alignment VerticalContentAlignment { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Alignment](../layout/alignment.md)

-----

### Methods

#### FindFocusableDescendant(Vector2, Direction)

Searches for a focusable child within this view that is reachable in the specified `direction`, and returns a result containing the view and search path if found.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.Input.FocusSearchResult FindFocusableDescendant(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 contentPosition, StardewUI.Direction direction);
```

##### Parameters

**`contentPosition`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
The search position, relative to where this view's content starts (after applying margin, borders and padding).

**`direction`** &nbsp; [Direction](../direction.md)  
The search direction.

##### Returns

[FocusSearchResult](../input/focussearchresult.md)

##### Remarks

This is the same as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) but in pre-transformed content coordinates, and does not require checking for "self-focus" as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) already does this. The default implementation simply returns `null` as most views do not have children; subclasses with children must override this.

-----

#### GetBorderThickness()

Measures the thickness of each edge of the border, if the view has a border.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.Layout.Edges GetBorderThickness();
```

##### Returns

[Edges](../layout/edges.md)

  The border edge thicknesses.

##### Remarks

Used only by views that will implement a border via [OnDrawBorder(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#ondrawborderispritebatch). The border thickness is considered during layout, and generally treated as additional [Padding](../view.md#padding) for the purposes of setting allowed content size. 

 Borders usually have a static size, but if the thickness can change, then implementations must account for it in their dirty checking ([IsContentDirty()](../view.md#iscontentdirty)).

-----

#### GetLocalChildren()

Gets the view's children with positions relative to the content area.

```cs
protected override System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<StardewUI.ViewChild> GetLocalChildren();
```

##### Returns

[IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1)<[ViewChild](../viewchild.md)>

##### Remarks

This has the same signature as [GetChildren(Boolean)](../view.md#getchildrenbool) but assumes that coordinates are in the same space as those used in [OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#ondrawcontentispritebatch), i.e. not accounting for margin/border/padding. These coordinates are automatically adjusted in the [GetChildren(Boolean)](../view.md#getchildrenbool) to be relative to the entire view. 

 The default implementation returns an empty sequence. Composite views must override this method in order for user interactions to behave correctly.

-----

#### HasOwnContent()

Checks if this view displays its own content, independent of any floating elements or children.

```cs
protected override bool HasOwnContent();
```

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

##### Remarks

This is used by [IsVisible(Vector2?)](../view.md#isvisiblevector2) to determine whether children need to be searched. If a view provides its own content, e.g. a label or image displaying text or a sprite, or a frame displaying a background/border, then the entire view's bounds are understood to have visible content. Otherwise, the view is only considered visible as a whole if at least one child is visible, and is only visible at any given point if there is an intersecting child at that point.

-----

#### IsContentDirty()

Checks whether or not the internal content/layout has changed.

```cs
protected override bool IsContentDirty();
```

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

  `true` if content has changed; otherwise `false`.

##### Remarks

The base implementation of [IsDirty()](../view.md#isdirty) only checks if the base layout attributes have changed, i.e. [Layout](../view.md#layout), [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), etc. It does not know about content/data in any subclasses; those that accept content parameters (like text) will typically use [DirtyTracker&lt;T&gt;](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md) to hold that content and should implement this method to check their [IsDirty](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) states.

#### OnDrawBorder(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the view's border, if it has one.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawBorder(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying [Margin](../view.md#margin) but before [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).

-----

#### ResetDirty()

Resets any dirty state associated with this view.

```cs
protected override void ResetDirty();
```

##### Remarks

This is called at the end of [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2), so that on the next pass, all state appears clean unless it was marked dirty after the last pass completed. The default implementation is a no-op; subclasses should use it to clear any private dirty state, e.g. via [ResetDirty()](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#resetdirty).
