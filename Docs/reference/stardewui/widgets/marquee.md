# Class Marquee

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Widgets](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

A scrolling marquee supporting any inner content.

```cs
[StardewUI.GenerateDescriptor]
public class Marquee : StardewUI.View
```

**Inheritance**  
[Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) ⇦ [View](../view.md) ⇦ Marquee

## Remarks

Works by doubling and shifting the drawing the portion and applying a clipping rectangle, and therefore should be used only for non-interactive content; clicks and focus searches will not be correct inside the content area.

## Details

### Constructors

#### Marquee()

Initializes a new instance of [Marquee](marquee.md).

```cs
public Marquee();
```

-----

### Properties

#### Content

Content to scroll inside the marquee.

```cs
public StardewUI.IView Content { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[IView](../iview.md)

-----

#### ExtraDistance

Distance in pixels between the copy of the content being scrolled "out" of the marquee, and the second copy of the content being scrolled "in".

```cs
public float ExtraDistance { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Single](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.single)

##### Remarks

For example, a marquee scrolling the text "Hello World" might at any given moment look like:

-----

#### Speed

Scrolling speed, in pixels per second.

```cs
public float Speed { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Single](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.single)

-----

### Methods

#### FindFocusableDescendant(Vector2, Direction)

Searches for a focusable child within this view that is reachable in the specified `direction`, and returns a result containing the view and search path if found.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.Input.FocusSearchResult FindFocusableDescendant(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 contentPosition, StardewUI.Direction direction);
```

##### Parameters

**`contentPosition`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
The search position, relative to where this view's content starts (after applying margin, borders and padding).

**`direction`** &nbsp; [Direction](../direction.md)  
The search direction.

##### Returns

[FocusSearchResult](../input/focussearchresult.md)

##### Remarks

This is the same as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) but in pre-transformed content coordinates, and does not require checking for "self-focus" as [FocusSearch(Vector2, Direction)](../view.md#focussearchvector2-direction) already does this. The default implementation simply returns `null` as most views do not have children; subclasses with children must override this.

-----

#### GetLocalChildren()

Gets the view's children with positions relative to the content area.

```cs
protected override System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<StardewUI.ViewChild> GetLocalChildren();
```

##### Returns

[IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1)<[ViewChild](../viewchild.md)>

##### Remarks

This has the same signature as [GetChildren()](../view.md#getchildren) but assumes that coordinates are in the same space as those used in [OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#ondrawcontentispritebatch), i.e. not accounting for margin/border/padding. These coordinates are automatically adjusted in the [GetChildren()](../view.md#getchildren) to be relative to the entire view. 

 The default implementation returns an empty sequence. Composite views must override this method in order for user interactions to behave correctly.

-----

#### IsContentDirty()

Checks whether or not the internal content/layout has changed.

```cs
protected override bool IsContentDirty();
```

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

  `true` if content has changed; otherwise `false`.

##### Remarks

The base implementation of [IsDirty()](../view.md#isdirty) only checks if the base layout attributes have changed, i.e. [Layout](../view.md#layout), [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), etc. It does not know about content/data in any subclasses; those that accept content parameters (like text) will typically use [DirtyTracker&lt;T&gt;](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md) to hold that content and should implement this method to check their [IsDirty](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) states.

-----

#### OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)

Draws the inner content of this view.

```cs
protected override void OnDrawContent(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteBatch b);
```

##### Parameters

**`b`** &nbsp; [ISpriteBatch](../graphics/ispritebatch.md)  
Sprite batch to hold the drawing output.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Draw(ISpriteBatch)](../view.md#drawispritebatch) after applying both [Margin](../view.md#margin) and [Padding](../view.md#padding).

-----

#### OnMeasure(Vector2)

Performs the internal layout.

```cs
protected override void OnMeasure(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 availableSize);
```

##### Parameters

**`availableSize`** &nbsp; [Vector2](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.html)  
Size available in the container, after applying padding, margin and borders.

##### Remarks

This is called from [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2) only when the layout is dirty (layout parameters or content changed) and a new layout is actually required. Subclasses must implement this and set [ContentSize](../view.md#contentsize) once layout is complete. Typically, [Resolve(Vector2, Func&lt;Vector2&gt;)](../layout/layoutparameters.md#resolvevector2-funcvector2) should be used in order to ensure that the original [LayoutParameters](../layout/layoutparameters.md) are respected (e.g. if the actual content size is smaller than the configured size). 

 The `availableSize` provided to the method is pre-adjusted for [Margin](../view.md#margin), [Padding](../view.md#padding), and any border determined by [GetBorderThickness()](../view.md#getborderthickness).

-----

#### ResetDirty()

Resets any dirty state associated with this view.

```cs
protected override void ResetDirty();
```

##### Remarks

This is called at the end of [Measure(Vector2)](../view.md#measurevector2), so that on the next pass, all state appears clean unless it was marked dirty after the last pass completed. The default implementation is a no-op; subclasses should use it to clear any private dirty state, e.g. via [ResetDirty()](../layout/dirtytracker-1.md#resetdirty).
