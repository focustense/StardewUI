## Details

### Constructors

#### KeybindOverlay(ISpriteMap&lt;SButton&gt;)

Overlay control for editing a keybinding, or list of bindings.

```cs
public KeybindOverlay(StardewUI.Graphics.ISpriteMap<StardewModdingAPI.SButton> spriteMap);
```

##### Parameters

**`spriteMap`** &nbsp; [ISpriteMap](../../graphics/ispritemap-1.md)<SButton>  
Map of bindable buttons to sprite representations.

-----

### Properties

#### AddButtonText

Text to display on the button used to add a new binding.

```cs
public string AddButtonText { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string)

##### Remarks

If not specified, the button will use a generic "+" image instead.

-----

#### DeleteButtonTooltip

Tooltip to display for the delete (trash can) button beside each existing binding.

```cs
public string DeleteButtonTooltip { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string)

##### Remarks

If not specified, the delete buttons will have no tooltips.

-----

#### KeybindList

The current keybinds to display in the list.

```cs
public StardewModdingAPI.Utilities.KeybindList KeybindList { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

KeybindList

-----

#### KeybindType

Specifies what kind of keybind is being edited.

```cs
public StardewUI.Widgets.Keybinding.KeybindType KeybindType { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

[KeybindType](keybindtype.md)

##### Remarks

This determines the behavior of the capturing as well as what happens after capture: 

  - [MultipleKeybinds](keybindtype.md#multiplekeybinds) displays the list of existing keybinds (if any), adds the captured keybind when all buttons/keys are released, and allows adding more;
  - [SingleKeybind](keybindtype.md#singlekeybind) does not display the list or separator, and when all buttons/keys are released, updates its [KeybindList](keybindoverlay.md#keybindlist) to have that single keybind and closes the overlay.
  - [SingleButton](keybindtype.md#singlebutton) is similar to [SingleKeybind](keybindtype.md#singlekeybind) but records the keybind and closes the overlay as soon as a single button is pressed.

 Typically when using single-bind or single-button modes, the caller should [StartCapturing()](keybindoverlay.md#startcapturing) upon creation of the overlay in order to minimize redundant clicks.

-----

### Methods

#### CreateView()

Creates the content view that will be displayed as an overlay.

```cs
protected override StardewUI.IView CreateView();
```

##### Returns

[IView](../../iview.md)

-----

#### StartCapturing()

Starts capturing a new keybind.

```cs
public void StartCapturing();
```

##### Remarks

This makes the capture area start flashing and hides the "Add" button; any buttons pressed in the capturing state are recorded and combined into a single keybind after the capture ends, when all buttons are released.

-----

#### Update(TimeSpan)

Runs on every game update tick.

```cs
public override void Update(System.TimeSpan elapsed);
```

##### Parameters

**`elapsed`** &nbsp; [TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan)  
The amount of real time elapsed since the last tick.
