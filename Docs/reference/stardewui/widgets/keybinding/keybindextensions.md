## Details

### Methods

#### KeybindEquals(Keybind, Keybind)

Checks if two keybind instances are equal.

```cs
public static bool KeybindEquals(StardewModdingAPI.Utilities.Keybind keybind, StardewModdingAPI.Utilities.Keybind other);
```

##### Parameters

  `true` if `keybind` has the same Buttons as `other` and in the same order, otherwise `false`.

```cs
public static bool KeybindEquals(StardewModdingAPI.Utilities.KeybindList keybindList, StardewModdingAPI.Utilities.KeybindList other);
```

##### Parameters

**`keybindList`** &nbsp; KeybindList

**`other`** &nbsp; KeybindList  
The second keybind list to compare.

##### Returns
