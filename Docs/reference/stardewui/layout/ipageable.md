# Interface IPageable

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Layout](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

Signals that an [IView](../iview.md) implements paging controls.

```cs
public interface IPageable
```

## Remarks

Paging controls are a gamepad function. While next/previous arrows are usually clickable and have their own navigation logic, controller users generally should be able to use the shoulder buttons to navigate pages, which this interface enables.
