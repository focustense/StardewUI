# Interface ITabbable

## Definition

<div class="api-definition" markdown>

Namespace: [StardewUI.Layout](index.md)  
Assembly: StardewUI.dll  

</div>

Signals that an [IView](../iview.md) implements tab controls.

```cs
public interface ITabbable
```

## Remarks

Tab controls are a gamepad function. While tabs are usually clickable and have their own navigation logic, controller users should be able to use the trigger buttons to navigate tabs, which this interface enables.
