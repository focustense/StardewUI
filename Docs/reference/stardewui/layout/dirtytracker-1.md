## Details

### Constructors

#### DirtyTracker&lt;T&gt;(T)

Convenience class for tracking properties that have changed, i.e. for layout dirty checking.

```cs
public DirtyTracker<T>(T initialValue);
```

##### Parameters

**`initialValue`** &nbsp; T  
Value to initialize with.

##### Remarks

Will not flag changes as dirty unless the changed value is different from previous. Requires a correct `Equals(Object)` implementation for this to work, typically meaning strings, primitives and records.

-----

### Properties

#### IsDirty

Whether or not the value is dirty, i.e. has changed since the last call to [ResetDirty()](dirtytracker-1.md#resetdirty).

```cs
public bool IsDirty { get; private set; }
```

##### Property Value

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

-----

#### Value

The currently-held value.

```cs
public T Value { get; set; }
```

##### Property Value

`T`

-----

### Methods

#### ResetDirty()

Resets the dirty flag, so that [IsDirty](dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) returns `false` until the [Value](dirtytracker-1.md#value) is changed again.

```cs
public void ResetDirty();
```

-----

#### SetIfChanged(T)

Updates the tracker with a new value, if it has changed since the last seen value.

```cs
public bool SetIfChanged(T value);
```

##### Parameters

**`value`** &nbsp; T  
The new value.

##### Returns

[Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)

  `true` if the `value` was different from the previous [Value](dirtytracker-1.md#value), otherwise `false`.

##### Remarks

If this method returns `true`, then [IsDirty](dirtytracker-1.md#isdirty) will always also be `true` afterward. However, if it returns `false` then the dirty state simply remains unchanged, and will only be `false` if the value was not already dirty from a previous change.
