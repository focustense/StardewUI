Can it be animated?</p> <p>The <code>SpriteBatch</code> is just a blank canvas on which to draw; views provide the reusability, interactivity, reactivity, and everything else we've come to expect from a user interface.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#layout-views-and-view-trees","title":"Layout views and view trees","text":"<p>So far, we've only touched on basic view types like labels and images, but the real power of StardewUI is in its layout system which is based on layout views.</p> <p>A layout view isn't a specific type, or supertype; it describes any view that is responsible for laying out (positioning and sizing) at least one other view, with those other views being considered the children of the layout view. Together they form a tree:</p> <p>Example</p> <p></p> Lane: Menu Banner: Settings Frame: Border Label: Speed Lane: Row 1 Label: Enable turbo boost Checkbox Lane: Row 2 Label: Speed multiplier Slider <p>The structure is the same whether you're using the Core Library or StarML. At the end of the day, everything resolves to a pixel position, but you almost never deal with pixel positions directly; instead, you work with views (or elements, in StarML), and the layout views\u2014in the above example, the Frame and Lanes\u2014decide how to lay out their children\u2014in this case, the various Labels, Checkbox and Slider.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#layout","title":"Layout","text":"<p>Many of the pages on this site refer to layout, but what actually is layout?</p> <p>Microsoft's definition is useful here:</p> <p>At its simplest, layout is a recursive system that leads to an element being sized, positioned, and drawn. More specifically, layout describes the process of measuring and arranging the members of a [Layout View] element's <code>Children</code> collection.</p> <p>The original definition refers to a \"Panel\"; the equivalent concept in StardewUI is a \"layout view\".</p> <p>Much like Microsoft's WPF \u2013 and Android, and Apple's UIKit, and the majority of UI frameworks \u2013 StardewUI layout is completed in two recursive passes:</p> <ol> <li>The Measure Pass, in which children (which may themselves be layout views) are assigned sizes based on (a) the amount of available space, or limits, and (b) the amount of space they want, which could be based on the limits, or be a fixed size, or be a function of the content, or multiple or none of the above. The important thing is that each view is told how much space, horizontal and vertical, that it is allowed to use, and then reports back how much it will use.</li> <li>The Layout Pass, in which all the size measurements are combined in order to determine the pixel positions (relative to the parent) of each view. Sometimes this might just mean stacking left-to-right or top-to-bottom, e.g. in a <code>Lane</code> but for other layout types it could involve alignments, wrapping, clipping, offsetting, or doing nothing at all (e.g. drawing its children/content in place at position <code>(0, 0)</code>).</li> </ol> <p>These passes are somewhat implicit in StardewUI\u2014there are not separate methods named \"measure\" and \"layout\". However, it is how every layout view works inside its <code>Measure</code> method.</p> <p>More importantly, layout is inherently recursive. In order to measure its own width, a layout view must measure all of its children first, which requires measuring grandchildren, and so on. If we were to do this on every update tick, it would perform poorly, or at least no better than the equivalent immediate mode UI. To avoid this, StardewUI makes use of a common technique called dirty checking.</p> <p>Separate measure and layout passes allow us to do useful things that single-pass layouts tend to have trouble with\u2014for example, aligning content to both the left and right sides of a container, where the main content stretches to fill the remaining width:</p> Navigation Main Content Info Page 1 Contents of the current page; an item grid or list, NPC profile, options form, etc. Additional sidebar content Page 2 Page 3 <p>This layout is only possible with a measure pass, as we need to know the width of both the Navigation and Info columns (lanes) before it is possible to lay out the Main Content lane. In fact, this requires two measure passes (called initial and deferred) although that is an implementation detail of the layout view and not all layouts require a deferred pass.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#dirty-checking","title":"Dirty Checking","text":"<p>Rerunning layout on every tick would be expensive, so in order to avoid doing this, StardewUI\u2014like many frameworks\u2014employs a form of dirty-checking. This is sometimes referred to as \"invalidation\", and while there are some subtle differences between invalidation and dirty-checking, they are close enough to be considered the same for the purposes of this section.</p> <p>Invalidation/dirty checking is the process of keeping track of what state was modified (since the last completed layout) in addition to a view's current state. \"State\" is complex and view-specific but can generally be described as the combination of:</p> <ol> <li>Details of the layout request, e.g. the previous limits compared to new limits</li> <li>Values of any layout-affecting properties, such as the <code>LayoutParameters</code> (obviously) but also padding, margins, current text of a label<sup>1</sup>, current value of a slider, etc.</li> <li>The dirty state of any and all child views.</li> </ol> <p>Layout always proceeds from the top down, but dirty-checking cascades from the bottom up. This might seem like a bad thing\u2014yes, a change at any level of the view hierarchy means that the entire layout must be done again\u2014but in fact it is what allows large parts of the layout, and often the entire layout, to be skipped in each pass, reducing the \"typical\" workload to almost nothing. This is the basic principle behind a retained mode (as opposed to immediate-mode) UI.</p> <p>Consider our earlier example and suppose the slider value was changed. Because the slider is dirty, and that dirtiness cascades upward, the entire Menu Lane is effectively dirty. However:</p> <ol> <li>When the <code>Banner: Settings</code> view is measured, it sees that the limits have not changed, and since the banner itself is not dirty, it does not need to perform layout again; it can reuse the same layout as last frame.</li> <li>The <code>Frame: Border</code> is part of the dirty cascade, so it has to perform layout again. However, <code>Label: Speed</code> and <code>Lane: Row 1</code> end up in the same state as the banner; they are not dirty, and their limits are the same as before, so they skip layout.</li> <li>We then get to <code>Lane: Row 2</code>, which is dirty, and <code>Slider</code>, which of course requires new layout, although <code>Label: Speed multiplier</code> can also be skipped for the same reason as previous views.</li> </ol> <p>Thus in the end, we have only actually performed layout on 4 out of the 10 total views; the Menu Lane, Border Frame, Row 2 Lane and Slider. The larger and more complex a view tree gets, the more is saved by this branch-elimination; in a tree of 100 views, a single dirty property may involve fewer than 10 views in the layout update.</p> <p>This same logic can also apply if the change happens at the top level. For example, consider if <code>Lane: Menu</code> had its width increased (perhaps because we change the title of the \"Settings\" banner to something much longer), but <code>Frame: Border</code> is configured with a fixed width or maximum width. When layout is triggered, the entire <code>Frame: Border</code> can be skipped because its limit width hasn't changed and therefore the change in available width cannot affect it.</p> <p>If you ever run into a poorly-performing UI, use this knowledge to help. If you are frequently changing some content and that is causing slowdowns due to frequent layouts, you may be able to mitigate most of the impact by using a fixed-width container somewhere in between.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#data-binding","title":"Data Binding","text":"<p>A term from the heyday of visual database tools like Microsoft Access, the phrase Data Binding in modern usage refers to the ability of a UI framework to keep the state of the UI in sync with some data that is not part of the UI.</p> <p>Most real-world UI is not static. For example, you have a label that is supposed to display the name of some item. But which item?</p> <pre><code>&lt;label text=\"Parsnip\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>isn't very helpful unless you know the item is always going to be a Parsnip. When you build your own UI from scratch using <code>SpriteBatch</code>, you tell it exactly what text to display on every <code>draw</code> call. However, when you write StarML and use the Framework API to display it, you don't have access to the actual <code>Label</code> instance, nor any ability to set its <code>Text</code>. How do we make this display the name of any item, not just static text?</p> <p>The answer is a data binding:</p> <pre><code>&lt;label text={ItemName} /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Along with a model such as:</p> <pre><code>public class ViewData\n{\n    public string ItemName { get; set; } = \"\";\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The full details are covered in the StarML guide; at a conceptual level, what matters is that StardewUI does the synchronization work for you. You don't control the <code>Label</code> directly, but you don't need to, because you have bound its text to a model (<code>ViewData</code>) that you do control. <code>ViewData</code> is part of your mod.</p> <p>This style of UI development favors the \"Model-View\" family \u2013 informally, Model-View-Whatever.</p> <p>But, there's a catch... if you want these data bindings to be more than a one-shot deal\u2014that is, if you want to be able to change the <code>ItemName</code> and see the changes show up immediately in the UI\u2014then you need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged (aka: \"INPC\"). Doing so can be very tedious, so head on over to Binding Context for helpful tips and shortcuts to make it much faster and easier.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Whether or not a particular property truly alters the layout is not always certain; for example, a label that is constrained to 1 line may have no cascading effect if its parent is a horizontally-stretched or fixed vertical lane. However, the relationships in an arbitrary hierarchy can be surprisingly complex\u2014for example, a vertical lane that is horizontally content-sized might be affected by a change to the text of an inner label, but only if it is the longest label or becomes the longest label, etc.</p> <p>Because the effects can be so unpredictable, attempting to check whether layout will be affected can be almost as expensive and far more complex and bug-prone than simply redoing the layout; therefore, StardewUI generally just assumes that any dirty property means a new layout is required.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"examples/","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Curated list of examples built with StardewUI to demonstrate the many features of the framework and how to use them.</p> <p>The most current source for any example can usually be found in the <code>dev</code> branch of the test mod.

It would be impractical to try to anticipate every possible reason for a UI to exist, which is an almost infinite space: mod configuration, inventory, shops, NPC interactions, quests, minigames and more. StardewUI requires very little code to use, but it is still a C# framework.</p> <p>If you're interested in making, contributing to, or helping to define a more limited, content-pack friendly version, possibly based on Game State Queries, Trigger Actions and similar features, please consider either creating your own extension mod or starting/participating in a discussion on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"framework/binding-context/","title":"Binding Context","text":"<p>StardewUI's framework API is based on data binding. While the UI state or \"widget tree\" is retained, you don't interact it with it directly; instead, in order to provide interactivity and/or dynamic content to views, you define a data model, which becomes the context.</p> <p>Context is simply a tree node which contains the particular model/data for a specific view or position in the hierarchy.

There is one relevant property, named <code>Focusable</code> (or in StarML, the <code>focusable</code> attribute), which specifies whether or not that view should be able to independently receive focus.</p> <p>Some elements are assumed to want focus and automatically enable it (e.g. Buttons and Sliders), but the <code>focusable</code> property/attribute can also be added directly to any other type of view such as an Image.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>&lt;lane&gt;\n    &lt;button text=\"Cancel\" /&gt;\n    &lt;image focusable=\"true\" sprite={@Mods/MyMod/Sprites/UI:ConfirmButton} /&gt;\n&lt;lane&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Buttons are implicitly focusable; on the <code>&lt;image&gt;</code>, we simply add <code>focusable=\"true\"</code>.</p> <p>When a view is focusable, it becomes a candidate for the focus search that runs on every left stick movement or d-pad button press, and if StardewUI decides that it is the user's intended next target \u2013 e.g. if it is directly adjacent to the previously-focused view and in the requested direction \u2013 then the on-screen cursor will be moved (snapped) to its exact center, and it is then considered to have focus.</p>"},{"location":"framework/focus-and-interaction/#pointer-events","title":"Pointer Events","text":"<p>The most common purpose of element focus is for it to be able to receive clicks or other pointer events such as enter/leave (AKA mouseover/mouseout).

In StardewUI, this is all handled for you, and the behavior is largely identical to any other popular UI framework:</p> <ul> <li>First, the focused element \u2013 the deepest element that contains the cursor \u2013 gets a chance to handle the event.</li> <li>If that element either does not handle the click, or allows it to \"bubble\", then the element's parent also gets a chance at it.</li> <li>And so on until either the event is marked as Handled or the top-level view is reached.</li> </ul> <p>You never have to write code to figure out which element was clicked, hovered, etc. Simply add events to the elements you want, similar to the focusable attribute.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>It is not uncommon for the focusable element to be different from the element that handles pointer events. A great example of this is the drop-down list:</p> <p></p> <p>Recall that in a focus search, the cursor is moved to the center of the focusable element. The affordance of a drop-down list is its downward-pointing arrow, and that is where we want the cursor to land; it is the part that is \"focusable\".

Sometimes they are the same, e.g. with a button, but not always.</p> <p>This distinction is very particular to Stardew because of the \"snappy menu\" system; in conventional desktop and web UI, the location of the mouse pointer is irrelevant to and independent from keyboard or input focus, whereas in Stardew Valley, the pointer location is the only relevant information.</p>"},{"location":"framework/focus-and-interaction/#tooltips","title":"Tooltips","text":"<p>Similar to focusability, tooltips require only a single attribute, aptly named <code>tooltip</code>.

Custom views can create named outlets using the same attribute.</p> <p>If an <code>*outlet</code> is not specified in the markup, then the default (unnamed) outlet is assumed. When multiple outlets are available, the child limits still apply per-outlet; if any given outlet, default or named, only allows a single view, then attempting to assign multiple views to that outlet would be invalid.

For example, interpolations like <code>attr=\"{value1} {value2}\"</code> are valid HTML but not actually supported.</li> <li>Prior web development experience only helps through the shallowest part of the learning curve, not with binding/event attributes, model design, asset organization, etc.</li> <li>If all attributes are quoted, then character escaping becomes a more significant issue, especially for literal expressions; imagine documents full of <code></code>.</li> <li>An HTML parser only breaks the raw text down into stringly-typed elements and attributes; StardewUI would then need to do a second round of parsing (i.e. twice as much work) on all the tags and attribute values to determine which attributes are standard vs. structural, which values are literals vs. bindings vs. events, determine all the property names and types involved in an event handler, and so on.</li> <li>The actual runtime model (widget tree) is not comparable to an HTML DOM; does not understand unknown tags or standard HTML tags, does not distinguish between block/inline/other styles, and so on. As an abstraction over native UI, the inner workings are more like Qt or Android than a web browser; therefore, an \"it's just HTML\" approach would eventually end up causing more friction and confusion than a custom language.</li> </ul> <p>What about XML?</p> <p>An alternative would be something similar to XAML, but these have a way of getting out of control; consider, for example, a \"simple\" binding redirect in XAML:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Label Content=\"{Binding Path=DisplayName, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor AncestorLevel=1}}\"/&gt;\n&lt;Label Content=\"{Binding Path=DisplayName, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor AncestorType={x:Type Foo}}}\"/&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Compare to a StarML context redirect:</p> <pre><code>&lt;label text={^DisplayName} /&gt;\n&lt;label text={~Foo.DisplayName} /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>And this is without any binding modifiers which add even more noise to XAML.</p> <p>This is not intended as a slight against XAML, which is actually a very powerful and mature tool for cross-platform development and far better than most of the available alternatives. However, it reflects a different use case: backing an enormous framework (WPF) that is difficult to update once released, needs to scale to almost any imaginable UI scenario, and can expect a very high level of expertise from dev-users.</p> <p>It is precisely because XML is so extensible that XML-based languages become convoluted over time; they encourage a way of thinking wherein new features are designed to fit into the XML structure somehow, even if the existing syntax is already confusing, verbose or requires some separately-interpreted micro-grammar, instead of the alternative of making a tiny change to the parser to support a relatively simple addition, like the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>^</code> modifiers above.</p> <p>StardewUI is a mod, which means it is easy to change the parser, easy to roll out said updates, and has fewer users and UI scenarios to cover, so more effort can go into making easy things easy, instead of making nearly-impossible things possible.

Many of the standard views follow this pattern themselves; for example, a Checkbox is nothing more than a Lane with an Image and Label, with some properties and event handlers to tie them together.</p> <p>It is usually possible to do this using StarML alone, via the use of included views. However, this may start to feel awkward or clumsy if internal UI/layout state finds its way into the data model; or the view may require the use of overlays or animation which are cumbersome or impractical to control via the data binding system. For those cases, the solution tends to be a small amount of code that performs the same basic function as a StarML-based view, but without the requirement of a backing data model and with more flexibility to interact directly with the view properties and sometimes with the outside environment.</p> <p>These types of widgets are referred to as component views and the process for implementing one is simple and straightforward:</p> <ol> <li>Create a class inheriting from <code>ComponentView</code> or <code>ComponentView&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> is the type of the \"root\" view\u2014generally one of the standard layout views.</li> <li>Implement the <code>CreateView</code> method by creating the entire view tree.

These have the same concept, but the <code>View</code> has to be set directly, which means it is also nullable; inheriting from <code>DecoratorView&lt;T&gt;</code> is therefore more difficult and error prone than <code>ComponentView&lt;T&gt;</code> because a decorator's code has to be null-safe everywhere.

While the standard layouts should cover the majority of possible UI designs, it is always possible to run into situations that don't fit the mold, e.g. if an equivalent to WPF's WrapPanel were required. Similarly, if you wanted to draw using a custom effect (shader) instead of basic text and sprites, or need to control clipping (as in the Marquee), or are desaturating and re-tinting some other view, then <code>ComponentView</code> doesn't offer enough flexibility and you will need to inherit from <code>View</code> instead.</p> <p>As the heading suggests, there are only two required method implementations for <code>View</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>OnMeasure(Vector2)</code>, the view's contribution to the combined measure and layout pass;</li> <li><code>OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)</code>, which is where the actual rendering occurs.</li> </ul> <p>The Spacer source demonstrates the bare minimum, although the spacer does not actually do anything other than occupy space, so a custom <code>View</code> will be more involved.</p> <p>The main thing that <code>OnMeasure</code> must always do before returning is set the view's <code>ContentSize</code>, as this and only this is what layout views use to arrange content.

The more complex the layout, the more (potentially) involved the process will be.</p> <p>Roughly, the steps for implementing a layout view are:</p> <ol> <li>Decide whether the view can have only one child, like a Frame, or multiple children, such as a Panel. By convention, single-child views tend to refer to <code>Content</code> instead of <code>Children</code>, but this makes no difference to the layout system or to the StarML renderer.</li> <li>Add a dirty-tracking field; for a single child, a <code>DirtyTracker&lt;IView&gt;</code> and for a list, use <code>DirtyTrackingList&lt;IView&gt;</code>.</li> <li>Add an accessor property, dirty-check and dirty-reset as described in View Performance above. When implementing dirty checking, be sure to check both the tracker itself and the tracked view(s). For example, the logic for a list of children is: <code>children.IsDirty || children.Any(child =&gt; child.IsDirty())</code></li> <li>Perform child layout in <code>OnMeasure</code>. This depends on the specifics of your layout, so there is no standard set of sub-steps to follow, but the Grid and Panel implementations are good places to start. It is usually a good idea to store the results in a <code>List&lt;ViewChild&gt;</code> or other collection of <code>ViewChild</code>, as other methods will need to retrieve that specific type.</li> <li>Implement (override) <code>GetLocalChildren</code> and <code>FindFocusableDescendant</code>. The former is required to propagate events and updates, and the latter is required for focus searches. You can also override <code>GetLocalChildrenAt</code> if the view might have a very large number of children and a more optimal implementation than the default linear search is available, but this is optional.</li> </ol> <p>You'll notice that all of the overridable <code>View</code> methods use local coordinates, so they do not need to be concerned about screen positions or their overall place in the hierarchy.

Instead, the \"focused\" element is whichever focusable control is underneath the mouse/gamepad cursor at that exact moment. Focus search is therefore defined as determining the \"best\" (generally what users would perceive as nearest) focusable view in a given direction.</p> <p>There are no specific instructions because, like the <code>OnMeasure</code> implementation, it is completely dependent on the specific layout; a layout that arranges children in a horizontal line is going to have a very different implementation from one that arranges them in a grid, or in the same overlapping position. However, the following tips should prove helpful in getting to a correct implementation:</p> <ul> <li>All focus searches are recursive; if a direct child is not focusable, one of its own children/descendants may be. Therefore, when \"considering\" a child as a candidate for focus search, layout views must recursively run the focus search on that child.</li> <li>As a corollary to the above, finding an adjacent child that fails focus search (returns <code>null</code> from <code>FocusSearch</code>) does not mean that the search should stop; it means that the next child in the same direction must be queried, and so on until a match is found or there are no more views left.</li> <li>Focus search is not constrained to the container; it is a normal and expected part of the flow for focus to move from the last child of one layout view to the first child of another layout view. Do not expect the <code>contentPosition</code> to always be within the view's boundary, and do not skip focus searches when this occurs. Instead, try to return whichever focusable view the cursor might land on (or near) if it moved continuously from its current position\u2014which may be negative or out of bounds\u2014in the specified <code>direction</code>.</li> <li>Use the <code>ViewChild.IsInDirection</code> helper to help with matching instead of writing <code>switch</code> statements/expressions.</li> <li>If the <code>contentPosition</code> is completely out of bounds on both axes, or if movement in the specified <code>direction</code> will never intersect with any point within the layout boundaries, then return <code>null</code>.</li> </ul> <p>D-pad navigation in a non-uniform layout can often be ambiguous and there is not necessarily a single \"right answer\" for any given focus search.
