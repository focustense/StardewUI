Can it be animated?</p> <p>The <code>SpriteBatch</code> is just a blank canvas on which to draw; views provide the reusability, interactivity, reactivity, and everything else we've come to expect from a user interface.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#layout-views-and-view-trees","title":"Layout views and view trees","text":"<p>So far, we've only touched on basic view types like labels and images, but the real power of StardewUI is in its layout system which is based on layout views.</p> <p>A layout view isn't a specific type, or supertype; it describes any view that is responsible for laying out (positioning and sizing) at least one other view, with those other views being considered the children of the layout view. Together they form a tree:</p> <p>Example</p> <p></p> Lane: Menu Banner: Settings Frame: Border Label: Speed Lane: Row 1 Label: Enable turbo boost Checkbox Lane: Row 2 Label: Speed multiplier Slider <p>The structure is the same whether you're using the Core Library or StarML. At the end of the day, everything resolves to a pixel position, but you almost never deal with pixel positions directly; instead, you work with views (or elements, in StarML), and the layout views\u2014in the above example, the Frame and Lanes\u2014decide how to lay out their children\u2014in this case, the various Labels, Checkbox and Slider.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#layout","title":"Layout","text":"<p>Many of the pages on this site refer to layout, but what actually is layout?</p> <p>Microsoft's definition is useful here:</p> <p>At its simplest, layout is a recursive system that leads to an element being sized, positioned, and drawn. More specifically, layout describes the process of measuring and arranging the members of a [Layout View] element's <code>Children</code> collection.</p> <p>The original definition refers to a \"Panel\"; the equivalent concept in StardewUI is a \"layout view\".</p> <p>Much like Microsoft's WPF \u2013 and Android, and Apple's UIKit, and the majority of UI frameworks \u2013 StardewUI layout is completed in two recursive passes:</p> <ol> <li>The Measure Pass, in which children (which may themselves be layout views) are assigned sizes based on (a) the amount of available space, or limits, and (b) the amount of space they want, which could be based on the limits, or be a fixed size, or be a function of the content, or multiple or none of the above. The important thing is that each view is told how much space, horizontal and vertical, that it is allowed to use, and then reports back how much it will use.</li> <li>The Layout Pass, in which all the size measurements are combined in order to determine the pixel positions (relative to the parent) of each view. Sometimes this might just mean stacking left-to-right or top-to-bottom, e.g. in a <code>Lane</code> but for other layout types it could involve alignments, wrapping, clipping, offsetting, or doing nothing at all (e.g. drawing its children/content in place at position <code>(0, 0)</code>).</li> </ol> <p>These passes are somewhat implicit in StardewUI\u2014there are not separate methods named \"measure\" and \"layout\". However, it is how every layout view works inside its <code>Measure</code> method.</p> <p>More importantly, layout is inherently recursive. In order to measure its own width, a layout view must measure all of its children first, which requires measuring grandchildren, and so on. If we were to do this on every update tick, it would perform poorly, or at least no better than the equivalent immediate mode UI. To avoid this, StardewUI makes use of a common technique called dirty checking.</p> <p>Separate measure and layout passes allow us to do useful things that single-pass layouts tend to have trouble with\u2014for example, aligning content to both the left and right sides of a container, where the main content stretches to fill the remaining width:</p> Navigation Main Content Info Page 1 Contents of the current page; an item grid or list, NPC profile, options form, etc. Additional sidebar content Page 2 Page 3 <p>This layout is only possible with a measure pass, as we need to know the width of both the Navigation and Info columns (lanes) before it is possible to lay out the Main Content lane. In fact, this requires two measure passes (called initial and deferred) although that is an implementation detail of the layout view and not all layouts require a deferred pass.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#dirty-checking","title":"Dirty Checking","text":"<p>Rerunning layout on every tick would be expensive, so in order to avoid doing this, StardewUI\u2014like many frameworks\u2014employs a form of dirty-checking. This is sometimes referred to as \"invalidation\", and while there are some subtle differences between invalidation and dirty-checking, they are close enough to be considered the same for the purposes of this section.</p> <p>Invalidation/dirty checking is the process of keeping track of what state was modified (since the last completed layout) in addition to a view's current state. \"State\" is complex and view-specific but can generally be described as the combination of:</p> <ol> <li>Details of the layout request, e.g. the previous limits compared to new limits</li> <li>Values of any layout-affecting properties, such as the <code>LayoutParameters</code> (obviously) but also padding, margins, current text of a label<sup>1</sup>, current value of a slider, etc.</li> <li>The dirty state of any and all child views.</li> </ol> <p>Layout always proceeds from the top down, but dirty-checking cascades from the bottom up. This might seem like a bad thing\u2014yes, a change at any level of the view hierarchy means that the entire layout must be done again\u2014but in fact it is what allows large parts of the layout, and often the entire layout, to be skipped in each pass, reducing the \"typical\" workload to almost nothing. This is the basic principle behind a retained mode (as opposed to immediate-mode) UI.</p> <p>Consider our earlier example and suppose the slider value was changed. Because the slider is dirty, and that dirtiness cascades upward, the entire Menu Lane is effectively dirty. However:</p> <ol> <li>When the <code>Banner: Settings</code> view is measured, it sees that the limits have not changed, and since the banner itself is not dirty, it does not need to perform layout again; it can reuse the same layout as last frame.</li> <li>The <code>Frame: Border</code> is part of the dirty cascade, so it has to perform layout again. However, <code>Label: Speed</code> and <code>Lane: Row 1</code> end up in the same state as the banner; they are not dirty, and their limits are the same as before, so they skip layout.</li> <li>We then get to <code>Lane: Row 2</code>, which is dirty, and <code>Slider</code>, which of course requires new layout, although <code>Label: Speed multiplier</code> can also be skipped for the same reason as previous views.</li> </ol> <p>Thus in the end, we have only actually performed layout on 4 out of the 10 total views; the Menu Lane, Border Frame, Row 2 Lane and Slider. The larger and more complex a view tree gets, the more is saved by this branch-elimination; in a tree of 100 views, a single dirty property may involve fewer than 10 views in the layout update.</p> <p>This same logic can also apply if the change happens at the top level. For example, consider if <code>Lane: Menu</code> had its width increased (perhaps because we change the title of the \"Settings\" banner to something much longer), but <code>Frame: Border</code> is configured with a fixed width or maximum width. When layout is triggered, the entire <code>Frame: Border</code> can be skipped because its limit width hasn't changed and therefore the change in available width cannot affect it.</p> <p>If you ever run into a poorly-performing UI, use this knowledge to help. If you are frequently changing some content and that is causing slowdowns due to frequent layouts, you may be able to mitigate most of the impact by using a fixed-width container somewhere in between.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#data-binding","title":"Data Binding","text":"<p>A term from the heyday of visual database tools like Microsoft Access, the phrase Data Binding in modern usage refers to the ability of a UI framework to keep the state of the UI in sync with some data that is not part of the UI.</p> <p>Most real-world UI is not static. For example, you have a label that is supposed to display the name of some item. But which item?</p> <pre><code>&lt;label text=\"Parsnip\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>isn't very helpful unless you know the item is always going to be a Parsnip. When you build your own UI from scratch using <code>SpriteBatch</code>, you tell it exactly what text to display on every <code>draw</code> call. However, when you write StarML and use the Framework API to display it, you don't have access to the actual <code>Label</code> instance, nor any ability to set its <code>Text</code>. How do we make this display the name of any item, not just static text?</p> <p>The answer is a data binding:</p> <pre><code>&lt;label text={ItemName} /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Along with a model such as:</p> <pre><code>public class ViewData\n{\n    public string ItemName { get; set; } = \"\";\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The full details are covered in the StarML guide; at a conceptual level, what matters is that StardewUI does the synchronization work for you. You don't control the <code>Label</code> directly, but you don't need to, because you have bound its text to a model (<code>ViewData</code>) that you do control. <code>ViewData</code> is part of your mod.</p> <p>This style of UI development favors the \"Model-View\" family \u2013 informally, Model-View-Whatever.</p> <p>But, there's a catch... if you want these data bindings to be more than a one-shot deal\u2014that is, if you want to be able to change the <code>ItemName</code> and see the changes show up immediately in the UI\u2014then you need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged (aka: \"INPC\"). Doing so can be very tedious, so head on over to Binding Context for helpful tips and shortcuts to make it much faster and easier.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Whether or not a particular property truly alters the layout is not always certain; for example, a label that is constrained to 1 line may have no cascading effect if its parent is a horizontally-stretched or fixed vertical lane. However, the relationships in an arbitrary hierarchy can be surprisingly complex\u2014for example, a vertical lane that is horizontally content-sized might be affected by a change to the text of an inner label, but only if it is the longest label or becomes the longest label, etc.</p> <p>Because the effects can be so unpredictable, attempting to check whether layout will be affected can be almost as expensive and far more complex and bug-prone than simply redoing the layout; therefore, StardewUI generally just assumes that any dirty property means a new layout is required.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"examples/","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Curated list of examples built with StardewUI to demonstrate the many features of the framework and how to use them.</p> <p>The most current source for any example can usually be found in the <code>dev</code> branch of the test mod.

Parameterized behaviors are easier to write, and also easier to use.</p> <p>As an example, consider a complex hover state, in which we want to change all of the following on hover:</p> <ul> <li>Scale up and reposition the content slightly</li> <li>Tint the content or background a different color</li> <li>Raise the opacity, i.e. from semitransparent to fully opaque.</li> </ul> <p>Doing this all in a single attribute is extremely awkward and hard to parse, e.g.</p> <p><code>&lt;image +hover=\"transform:scale:1.2,translate:0, -2; background-tint:#ccf; opacity:1\" /&gt;</code></p> <p>In fact this is nearly impossible to parse correctly due to the overloaded <code>:</code> character, so we might have to change it to an <code>=</code>, but that makes it harder to read since the attribute assignment itself uses <code>=</code>. There simply isn't a good textual representation for this much data, barring an entire JSON serialization or other hack.</p> <p>Moreover, it would be very hard to implement this in a single behavior object because all the property types are different. <code>transform</code> takes a Transform, <code>background-tint</code> takes a Color, and <code>opacity</code> takes a <code>float</code>. This can't be represented in a single generic type without also having to use reflection.</p> <p>Enter arguments, which allow us to deal with a single property at a time instead, cleaning up both the syntax and implementation:</p> <pre><code>&lt;image +hover:transform=\"scale: 1.2, translate: 0, -2\"\n       +hover:background-tint=\"#ccf\"\n       +hover:opacity=\"1\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now the string values have the exact same format as the original attributes, and the behavior can be implemented using the type-safe method, requiring only a single generic parameter because it only deals with a single value.</p> <p>Argument parsing does potentially add some complexity to the behavior factory, especially if a variable type is involved; see for example the StateBehaviorFactory implementation. However, the small increase in factory complexity is usually worth the tradeoff for a much more significant decrease in behavior complexity, since behaviors are the part that the user actually sees, and factories run far less often and in a more constrained, predictable context.</p>"},{"location":"framework/behaviors/#view-state","title":"View State","text":"<p>Since behaviors are designed to look and feel like ordinary attributes, and are only able to act on existing views instead of replacing them, it logically follows that many if not most of them will perform the same function as an ordinary attribute (that is, writing a new value to one of the view's properties) but with more logic around their conditions or timing.</p> <p>A problem arises when multiple behaviors overlap. Consider a hypothetical case where:</p> <ol> <li>A view initially starts with a scale (transform) of 0.</li> <li>Behavior A (\"show\") changes the scale to 1 as soon as the view becomes visible.</li> <li>Behavior B (\"hover\") increases the scale to 1.2 while the pointer is inside the view.</li> <li>Behavior C (\"press\") decreases the scale to 1.1 while the mouse button is clicked.</li> </ol> <p>Note that the \"press\" state isn't really used in Stardew, since most \"clicks\" take effect immediately on click, rather than release. Nevertheless, most desktop and web apps do have a pressed state, so it makes for a useful example.</p> <p>A naive approach is to think of each of these behaviors simply as \"mutations\"\u2014implemented exactly as they are described above, by simply changing <code>IView.Transform</code> to the target value when their event is raised.</p> <p>This becomes almost immediately unworkable because there is no way to return to the default visible scale of 1.0 after a hover/press. We could add another 3 behaviors (\"hide\", \"leave\", \"release\") each with their own parameter, leading to significant duplication and bloat. Or, we could change behaviors A, B and C so that they handle both \"entering\" and \"exiting\" their respective state.</p> <p>A naive solution to this new problem would be to simply save the previous value before performing the mutation, and reverting it when exiting the state. Starting after the \"show\" state:</p> <p>Success</p> <ol> <li>Behavior B saves the previous scale of 1.0, and sets a new scale of 1.2, when the pointer enters the view.</li> <li>Behavior C saves the previous scale of 1.2, and sets a new scale of 1.1, when the button is pressed.</li> <li>Behavior C reverts to the value of 1.1 when the button is released.</li> <li>Behavior B reverts to the value of 1.0 when the pointer leaves the view.</li> </ol> <p>This is coding for the \"happy path\", when the user doesn't do anything \"strange\" or unexpected. However, when you start to reach 1k, 10k, 100k or more users, you must expect the unexpected. In this case, the unexpected is B and C exiting their states in reverse order. The mouse button being held and the pointer staying within a rectangular boundary are independent states. Users typically press and release without moving the pointer, but some may \"drag\" the pointer out, either intentionally or unintentionally due to lower mobility.</p> <p>The sad path starts out the same way but ends in the wrong state:</p> <p>Failure</p> <ol> <li>Behavior B saves the previous scale of 1.0, and sets a new scale of 1.2, when the pointer enters the view.</li> <li>Behavior C saves the previous scale of 1.2, and sets a new scale of 1.1, when the button is pressed.</li> <li>Behavior B reverts to the value of 1.0 when the pointer leaves the view.</li> <li>Behavior C reverts to the value of 1.1 when the button is released.</li> </ol> <p>The view is now stuck in the \"hover\" state even though it is no longer hovered. Users will\u2014correctly\u2014perceive this as a bug.</p> <p>While this outcome may seem benign\u2014you can \"fix\" it by simply hovering over the view again\u2014it is actually the simplest statement of the problem, which becomes exponentially more complicated if any transitional states are involved. If even one of these transitions is animated, then the \"saved\" value can literally end up being any value at all between 0 and 1.2, and the default visible value of 1.0 can become permanently lost.</p> <p>To deal with this, StardewUI introduces an abstraction called the View State, which provides two essential functions:</p> <ul> <li>An API to retrieve the default value for a given property, which takes into account any attributes/bindings used in the view;</li> <li>A priority queue-like structure for each property that contains all active states and their desired overrides, where the state on top is the one that takes effect in any given frame.</li> </ul> <p>Returning to the aforementioned example, we can now make this work regardless of the path the user takes:</p> <p>Success</p> <ol> <li>Behavior B pushes a \"hover\" state with scale of 1.2 when the pointer enters the view; effective scale is 1.2.</li> <li>Behavior C pushes a \"press\" state with a scale of 1.1 when the button is pressed; effective scale is 1.1.</li> <li>Behavior B removes the \"hover\" state; now the \"press\" state is on top, so effective scale is still 1.1.</li> <li>Behavior C removes the \"press\" state, and now no state is on top, so the view reverts to the default value of 1.0.</li> </ol> <p>More importantly, this works perfectly for transitional states because those behaviors do not read the transitional values from the view, they read the intended values from the property's state list, and therefore can never transition to a nonsense value due to a previous transition being prematurely stopped.</p> <p>Takeaway</p> <p>If you are writing a behavior that will modify one or more view properties, use the view state to ensure the behavior neither breaks nor is broken by overlapping behaviors. Avoid writing directly to the view whenever possible, and only read from the view directly if you actually depend on the immediate value and not the expected value (e.g. after all transitions finish).</p>"},{"location":"framework/behaviors/#data","title":"Data","text":"<p>A behavior's Data is the same as the value of a regular attribute.

But more importantly, recalling that constructors are matched by argument names and only then validated by their argument types, the <code>Edges(int horizontal, int vertical)</code> constructor is considered a better match here, despite ultimately proving incompatible, because it matches more properties than the 4-argument version. StardewUI won't backtrack; once it decides on the best constructor, it will stick to that constructor even if some argument conversions fail.</p> <p>While it's very debatable what the right course of action might have been in this specific case, it is impossible for StardewUI to always guess right because the intent of the (hypothetical) author here is ambiguous.

The scrollbar still helps, but it is complementary, not necessary.</p> <p>TL;DR</p> <p>Always set your <code>peeking</code>. When possible, set it to 2-3x of the distance of a typical scroll; if rows are 80px high, a good peeking value is anywhere from 160px to 240px.</p>"},{"location":"framework/focus-and-interaction/#tabbing-and-paging","title":"Tabbing and Paging","text":"<p>Two types of UI in Stardew generally receive special input treatment:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tab controls, such as the main menu's top tabs, which have individually focusable and clickable buttons to switch the current tab but are also supposed to respond to the controller's trigger buttons\u2014generally, L2 and R2\u2014to switch to the previous or next tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pagination or pageable sections, which can either be used as \"big scrolls\" or to replace the current page completely.

While the standard layouts should cover the majority of possible UI designs, it is always possible to run into situations that don't fit the mold, e.g. if an equivalent to WPF's WrapPanel were required. Similarly, if you wanted to draw using a custom effect (shader) instead of basic text and sprites, or need to control clipping (as in the Marquee), or are desaturating and re-tinting some other view, then <code>ComponentView</code> doesn't offer enough flexibility and you will need to inherit from <code>View</code> instead.</p> <p>As the heading suggests, there are only two required method implementations for <code>View</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>OnMeasure(Vector2)</code>, the view's contribution to the combined measure and layout pass;</li> <li><code>OnDrawContent(ISpriteBatch)</code>, which is where the actual rendering occurs.</li> </ul> <p>The Spacer source demonstrates the bare minimum, although the spacer does not actually do anything other than occupy space, so a custom <code>View</code> will be more involved. For a more comprehensive example, see the source for the test addon's Carousel view, also shown in the Carousel example.</p> <p>The main thing that <code>OnMeasure</code> must always do before returning is set the view's <code>ContentSize</code>, as this and only this is what layout views use to arrange content. If <code>ContentSize</code> is not set, the view will be \"laid out\" with a size of zero, and anything it tries to draw may overlap with or be overwritten by other views.</p> <p>Almost every <code>OnMeasure</code> method should start with the line:</p> <pre><code>var limits = Layout.GetLimits(availableSize);\n</code></pre> <p>This translates the view's LayoutParameters into an actual pixel size representing the maximum width and height available for use by that view. The <code>availableSize</code> argument is what the parent is willing to give; the <code>limits</code> derived from <code>GetLimits</code> are what the view is willing to take.</p> <p>Similarly, <code>ContentSize</code> should normally be set using some variant of:</p> <pre><code>ContentSize = Layout.Resolve(availableSize, () =&gt; childrenSize);\n</code></pre> <p>Where <code>maxChildSize</code> is the accumulated size of all child views after layout has finished on them. Using <code>Resolve</code> in this context ensures that the length type of each dimension and other constraints such as min/max width and height are all respected.</p> <p>Aside from setting <code>ContentSize</code>, <code>OnMeasure</code> is also the place to perform any updates in response to the view's size or content changing; for example, performing layout on a NineSlice, breaking/wrapping text into lines, etc.</p>"},{"location":"library/custom-views/#view-performance","title":"View Performance","text":"<p>As a <code>View</code> implementer, it becomes your responsibility to ensure that the layout and rendering methods are efficient and not janky.

When implementing dirty checking, be sure to check both the tracker itself and the tracked view(s). For example, the logic for a list of children is: <code>children.IsDirty || children.Any(child =&gt; child.IsDirty())</code></li> <li>Perform child layout in <code>OnMeasure</code>. This depends on the specifics of your layout, so there is no standard set of sub-steps to follow, but the Grid and Panel implementations are good places to start. It is usually a good idea to store the results in a <code>List&lt;ViewChild&gt;</code> or other collection of <code>ViewChild</code>, as other methods will need to retrieve that specific type.</li> <li>Implement (override) <code>GetLocalChildren</code> and <code>FindFocusableDescendant</code>. The former is required to propagate events and updates, and the latter is required for focus searches. You can also override <code>GetLocalChildrenAt</code> if the view might have a very large number of children and a more optimal implementation than the default linear search is available, but this is optional.</li> </ol> <p>You'll notice that all of the overridable <code>View</code> methods use local coordinates, so they do not need to be concerned about screen positions or their overall place in the hierarchy.

Focus search is therefore defined as determining the \"best\" (generally what users would perceive as nearest) focusable view in a given direction.</p> <p>There are no specific instructions because, like the <code>OnMeasure</code> implementation, it is completely dependent on the specific layout; a layout that arranges children in a horizontal line is going to have a very different implementation from one that arranges them in a grid, or in the same overlapping position. However, the following tips should prove helpful in getting to a correct implementation:</p> <ul> <li>All focus searches are recursive; if a direct child is not focusable, one of its own children/descendants may be. Therefore, when \"considering\" a child as a candidate for focus search, layout views must recursively run the focus search on that child.</li> <li>As a corollary to the above, finding an adjacent child that fails focus search (returns <code>null</code> from <code>FocusSearch</code>) does not mean that the search should stop; it means that the next child in the same direction must be queried, and so on until a match is found or there are no more views left.</li> <li>Focus search is not constrained to the container; it is a normal and expected part of the flow for focus to move from the last child of one layout view to the first child of another layout view. Do not expect the <code>contentPosition</code> to always be within the view's boundary, and do not skip focus searches when this occurs.

However, because UI flows explicitly from top-left to bottom-right, rather than expanding equally in all directions, this center origin is not actually the default behavior.

For rotations, scales and other arbitrary matrix transforms, however, the result's apparent position on screen will be significantly affected by the origin.</p> <p>StardewUI's TransformOrigin works in the same intuitive way as the CSS <code>transform-origin</code> property, not the awkward <code>origin</code> argument in XNA/MonoGame APIs. Specifically, modifying the transform origin only affects the transform itself, not the actual position of the object. Changing the <code>transform-origin</code> in StardewUI/StarML has no effect until an origin-sensitive <code>transform</code> is added.</p> <p>Transform origins are vectors between <code>(0, 0)</code> and <code>(1, 1)</code> and are relative to the size of the transformed view:</p> <ul> <li><code>(0, 0)</code> transforms around the top-left corner (default)</li> <li><code>(0.5, 0.5)</code> transforms around the center</li> <li><code>(1, 1)</code> transforms around the bottom-right corner.</li> </ul> <p>Any <code>Vector2</code> is technically allowed but the three above are the most commonly-used.

In StardewUI, this is not the case; transform strings are used to build a single Transform, with a single component each for scale, rotation and translation, and duplicate values are ignored.</p> <p>For example, with CSS transforms, the following values all produce different results:</p> <ul> <li><code>translateX(100px) rotate(45deg) translateX(100px)</code></li> <li><code>translateX(200px) rotate(45deg)</code></li> <li><code>rotate(45deg) translateX(200px)</code>.</li> </ul> <p>However, in StardewUI, the following values all produce the same result:</p> <ul> <li><code>translateX: 100; rotate: 45</code></li> <li><code>translateX: 100; rotate: 45; translateX: 100</code></li> <li><code>rotate: 45; translateX: 100</code></li> </ul> <p>This is because all the different components are combined by the parser into a single local <code>Transform</code> which will have a Translation of <code>100, 0</code> and Rotation of <code>\ud835\udf0b/4</code> rads.</p> <p>StardewUI's parser does have logic to combine \"x\" and \"y\" properties; for example, <code>scaleX: 1.2, scaleY: 1.4</code> will be combined into a transform whose scale is the vector <code>(1.2, 1.4)</code>. However, the values do not accumulate, only the attributes; duplicate attributes will replace the previous value, which is why <code>translateX: 456, translateX: 100</code> simply produces a translation of <code>(100, 0)</code>.</p> <p>Local transformations involving arbitrarily-long sequences, as in the CSS example earlier, are rare in practice, but if it is necessary to produce a similar outcome in StardewUI, then it can only be done using nested transforms, such as:</p> <pre><code>&lt;panel transform=\"translateX: 100; rotate: 45\"&gt;\n    &lt;panel transform=\"translateX: 100\"&gt;\n        &lt;!-- transformed content --&gt;\n    &lt;/panel&gt;\n&lt;/panel&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Components of local transformations always apply in the same order: first scale, then rotation, then translation. However, different people visualize the transformation process differently (in model space vs. in view/world space), therefore the CSS comparison can be used as a reference. Specifically, in StardewUI, any of the following transform strings:</p> <ul> <li><code>rotate: 45; translateX: 100; scale: 1.5</code></li> <li><code>scale: 1.5; translateX: 100; rotate: 45</code></li> <li><code>translateX: 100; scale: 1.5; rotate: 45</code></li> </ul> <p>are always equivalent to the following in CSS:</p> <p><code>translateX(100px) rotate(45deg) scale(1.5)</code></p> <p>And this equivalence is because web browsers perform CSS translations in right-to-left order.</p>"},{"location":"reference/stardewui/","title":"StardewUI","text":"","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/#stardewui-namespace","title":"StardewUI Namespace","text":"","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/#classes","title":"Classes","text":"Name Description DirectionExtensions Helpers for working with Direction.

CheckboxUnchecked Unchecked checkbox, i.e. only the border. CloseButton Red X with border/background, generally used as upper-right close button for menus. ControlBorder Border/background sprite for an individual control, such as a button. Less prominent than MenuBorder. ControlBorderUncolored Colorless border/background sprite for an individual control, such as a button. Less prominent than MenuBorderUncolored. Digits List of sprites for the outlined \"tiny digits\" 0-9, in that order. DropDownBackground Background of a drop-down menu. DropDownButton Button to pull down a drop-down menu. GenericHorizontalDivider Simpler, lighter horizontal divider than the MenuHorizontalDivider, used as a horizontal rule to separate content areas without sectioning the entire menu.

Used for drawing the outer border of an entire menu UI. MenuBorderThickness The actual distance from the outer edges of the MenuBorder sprite to where the actual \"border\" really ends, in terms of pixels. The border tiles are quite large, so this tends to be needed in order to determine where the content should go without adding a ton of extra padding. MenuBorderUncolored Colorless version of the modified 9-slice sprite used for the menu border, based on menu \"tiles\". Used for drawing the outer border of an entire menu UI. MenuHorizontalDivider Modified 9-slice sprite used for the menu's horizontal divider, meant to be drawn over top of the MenuBorder to denote separate \"sub-panels\" or \"sections\" of the menu to group logically very different menu functions (as opposed to lines on a grid). MenuHorizontalDividerMargin Margin adjustment to apply to content adjacent to a MenuHorizontalDivider to make content flush with the border; adjusts for internal sprite padding. MenuHorizontalDividerUncolored Colorless version of the modified 9-slice sprite used for the menu's horizontal divider, meant to be drawn over top of the MenuBorderUncolored to denote separate \"sub-panels\" or \"sections\" of the menu to group logically very different menu functions (as opposed to lines on a grid).

For example, in a 1D horizontal layout the rules might be: </p> <ul> <li>If the <code>direction</code> is East, and the position's X value is negative, then the result should the leftmost focusable child, regardless of Y value.</li> <li>If the direction is South, and the X position is within the view's horizontal bounds, and the Y value is negative or greater than the view's height, then result should be whichever child intersects with that X position.</li> <li>If the direction is West and the X position is negative, or the direction is East and the X position is greater than the view's width, then the result should be <code>null</code> as there is literally nothing the view knows about in that direction.</li> </ul> <p>There are no strict rules for how a view performs focus search, but in general it is assumed that a view implementation understands its own layout and can accommodate accordingly; for example, a grid would follow essentially the same rules as our \"list\" example above, with additional considerations for navigating rows. \"Ragged\" 2D layouts might have complex rules requiring explicit neighbors, and therefore are typically easier to implement as nested lanes.</p>","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/widgets/decoratorview-1/#getchildatvector2-bool-bool","title":"GetChildAt(Vector2, bool, bool)","text":"<p>Finds the child at a given position.</p> <pre><code>public virtual StardewUI.ViewChild GetChildAt(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2 position, bool preferFocusable, bool requirePointerEvents);\n</code></pre>","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/widgets/decoratorview-1/#parameters_3","title":"Parameters","text":"<p><code>position</code> Vector2 The search position, relative to the view's top-left coordinate.</p> <p><code>preferFocusable</code> Boolean <code>true</code> to prioritize a focusable child over a non-focusable child with a higher z-index in case of overlap; <code>false</code> to always use the topmost child.</p> <p><code>requirePointerEvents</code> Boolean Whether to exclude views whose PointerEventsEnabled is currently <code>false</code>.</p>","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/widgets/decoratorview-1/#returns_2","title":"Returns","text":"<p>ViewChild</p> <p>The view at <code>position</code>, or <code>null</code> if there is no match.</p>","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/widgets/decoratorview-1/#remarks_12","title":"Remarks","text":"<p>If multiple children overlap the same position, then this returns the topmost child, i.e. with the highest ZIndex.</p>","boost":0.002},{"location":"reference/stardewui/widgets/decoratorview-1/#getchildpositioniview","title":"GetChildPosition(IView)","text":"<p>Computes or retrieves the position of a given direct child.</p> <pre><code>public virtual Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2?
